When people want to go to the gym, they do not always have the easiest time finding someone to go with. The current ways people find gym buddies is a combination of text messages, different forms of social media, meeting someone at the gym, asking a someone you already know and even the occasional phone call. For a user to team up with a nearby workout warrior, the user must send a direct message to a current friend, wait for the friend to respond, begin dialogue, and then decide on a schedule for their workout(s). This is a non-exhaustive list of the steps required to plan a workout session. In addition, this method does not take into consideration users not currently in the 'friend circle,' which exponentially decreases fitness partnership opportunities. There is currently, no tool that we know of that simplifies this process. By providing a way to pick out someone whose interests coincide with yours we will facilitate the way people find that perfect gym buddy by saving them time through a usable and intuitive design that helps make the process quick and reliable.
